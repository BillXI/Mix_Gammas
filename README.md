# Mix_Gammas

## How to use the code:

1. Need to geneare the .sh files: run the "GenerateSH.R" and change the parameters inside.
2. Make sure change the save location in the files in Code/
3. Run the "sbatch simulation.sh"

## Progress:
2017, Nov 24
* adding k = k to the gammamixEM.new function.
* Re-install the mixtools to the local library. 
* Re-running the simulation now. (4:25 pm).
* Changed the simulation.sh file. Interestingly the old one not working, probabue due to the sh update.

2017 Summer: 
* Finished simulation (see Results/2017_5_11/)
